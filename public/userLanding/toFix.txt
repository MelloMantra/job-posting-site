- add a view that allows users to click on the job which gives them a detailed view, and they can apply for it as well.
I'd make this general and on a seperate file so that it can be used in the main job search part as well.
- make sure it works on mobile
- make sure the json data being used is in the same format as that which will be inputted by my integration, because I'm almost certain it is not
text me or check one of the many schema diagrams I've sent for the fields and their order.
- there is a weird loading bar at the top of the applications/opportunities, not sure why or if that should be there but if not I'd fix
- also please do the same thing with applications and open up a detailed view of the job when it's clicked on using the json job data (which should also be in proper format)
